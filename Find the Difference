Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:

Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.


class Solution:
    
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        diff=0
        for char in s:
            diff^=ord(char)
        for char in t:
            diff^=ord(char)
        return chr(diff)
